   **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

    When it comes to ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I can heavily rely on the help
    of an IDE like Eclipse, as well is by using automated testing. With this, I am able to ensure that my code is working as 
    it should be, and giving errors for the right reasons. I am also able to ensure that it meets the requirements of the 
    user's needs.
    
   **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
    
    When interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program, I make a list. I will write down all of the 
    requirements, and any additional information I think I may want to add (such as how I want to write the code: 
    loop, if/else). I also will check off the requirements as I am coding them. This allows me to keep track of what is
    missing, and what has been completed. This is how I have been doing it since the start of my coding, and it has 
    worked for me. 
    
   **How do I approach designing software?**

   Designing software is no easy task. There is a lot that goes into it, and a lot that can go wrong. I like to think that 
   the approach I have is simply baby steps. I take everything slowly and one step at a time. If I ever get stuck, I try to
   use coding forums to aid in a solution. If that does not work, I simply walk away. Walking away allows me to clear 
   my head, and see things I may have missed previously. I repeat this as many times as needed until the task is
   complete.
